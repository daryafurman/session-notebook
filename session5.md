## Git pull requests

GitHub offers us pull requests (PR) which we can use as a convenient way to request reviews of the work on a feature branch.

A pull request is a request to merge one branch into another branch. Other developers review the PR and suggest changes. If a pull request is approved we can merge the feature branch into the main branch.
